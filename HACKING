Howto: Add support for a new website
------------------------------------

  cclive internals
  ----------------

  cclive fetches the video page from the specified link, parses it
  looking for specific strings and constructs the video extraction
  link from these details. Additionally cclive parses video ID
  for identifying and file naming purposes.

  If the parsing returns the expected results, cclive then proceeds
  to download the video from the constructed video link.

  Hackalot
  --------

  Usually the hardest part is the figuring out how to extract the
  video from the website. Some websites see little reason to hide
  the video link, others can go great lengths trying to make it
  impossible.

  The easiest ones have their links visible in the video page HTML.
  See src/evisor.cpp for an example of this.

  Often, most of the hard ones can be figured out by analyzing the
  flash generated TCP traffic. See:
    http://code.google.com/p/clive/issues/detail?id=6

  The above obviously requires that you have access to a system
  capable of running flash.

  Whatever the case is, the following info summarizes how to add
  the support to the program once the details have been sorted out.

  Adding support to the program
  -----------------------------

  * src/hosthandler.h
    - add new $host specific class derived from the HostHandler class

  * src/hostfactory.h
    - add new $host specific enum to the list

  * src/hostfactory.cpp
    - add the new enum to createHandler(HandlerType) switch

  * src/$host.cpp
    - create implementation file for the $hostHandler class
    - for examples, see src/youtube.cpp, src/google.cpp etc.

  * src/Makefile.am
    - append $host.cpp to "host"

  * tests/$host.url
    - add a test link for the $host

  * tests/multi.lst (optional, recommended)
    - append the above link to this file

  * tests/Makefile.am
    - append $host.url to "EXTRA_DIST"

  Test and development
  --------------------

  * autoreconf && ./configure
    - needed after modifying the *.am files above
  
  * make && ./src/cclive < tests/$host.url -n
    - build and test

  Patches away
  ------------

  * generate a patch
    - submit it to cclive@googlegroups.com for review
    - please use diff -u (unified format)
