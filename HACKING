Howto: Add support for a new website

  Notes

  Common to these websites is the flash plugin requirement. Common
  the to the users of (c)clive is that we either choose not to
  install the plugin or simply cannot use it.

  The hardest part is the figuring out how to extract the video
  from the website. Some see little reason to hide the video links,
  others can go great lengths trying to make it impossible.

  The easiest ones have their links visible in the video page HTML.
  See src/evisor.cpp.

  In difficult cases, analyzing the flash generated TCP traffic may
  be used to figure how the video link is constructed. See:
    <http://code.google.com/p/clive/issues/detail?id=6>

  The above obviously requires that you have access to a system
  capable of running flash.

  Whatever the case is, the following info summarizes how to add
  the support to the program once the details have been sorted out.


  Adding support to the program:

  * src/hosthandler.h
    - add new $host specific class derived from the HostHandler class

  * src/hostfactory.h
    - add new $host specific enum to the list

  * src/hostfactory.cpp
    - add the new enum to createHandler(HandlerType) switch

  * src/$host.cpp
    - create implementation file for the $hostHandler class
    - for examples, see src/youtube.cpp, src/google.cpp etc.

  * src/Makefile.am
    - append $host.cpp to "host"

  * tests/$host.url
    - add a test link for the $host

  * tests/multi.lst (optional, recommended)
    - append the above link to this file

  * tests/Makefile.am
    - append $host.url to "EXTRA_DIST"

  -- Test and development

  * autoreconf && ./configure
    - needed after modifying the *.am files above
  
  * make && ./src/cclive < tests/$host.url -n
    - build and test

  -- When done

  * generate a patch
    - submit it to cclive@googlegroups.com for review
    - please use diff -u (unified format)
