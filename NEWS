News about cclive releases
--------------------------

Release 0.5.0
-------------

The dependency of Perl HTML::Tokenizer Perl module have been replaced with
iconv and pcre for significantly lower system footprint.

With this release, cclive starts using video titles for filenames by default.
Previously this was only possible if cclive was build with Perl support.

The following options have been removed due to these changes:
  --title
    - obsolete since 0.4.1 after adding --filename-format
  --cclass, --no-cclass
    - previously used with Perl

New options:
  -r, --regexp [req. pcrecpp]
    - Defines the regular expression that can be used to "filter"
      video titles before they are used for filenames

  -g, --find-all [req. pcrecpp]
    - Used together with the above to repeat the matching to find
      all occurences, similar to Perl's /g option

  Example:
    cclive -gr "(\w|\s)" URL
