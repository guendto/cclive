cclive News
-----------

0.6.0
-------------

* Added new dependency for libquvi (http://quvi.googlecode.com/)

* libquvi will now take care of fetching pages, parsing them
for video links and verifying the links

* cclive will print "error: libquvi: ..." if the error occurred
in the library, and bug reports should therefore filed to the
quvi bug tracker, not cclive's tracker

* Added support for (cctv) multi-segment videos, see also:
  http://code.google.com/p/clive/issues/detail?id=45

* Adult websites are only supported if libquvi was built with
the support (default:no)

* CCLIVE_CURLINIT return code is now obsolete as libquvi
initializes libcurl

* Cleaned up code wise the retrying support

* Removed libiconv dependency; libquvi will take care of
character set conversions instead

* Tests ("make check") no longer run host specific tests,
this is now done in quvi

* Similarly, the ADULT_OK environment variable is no longer
used by the tests ("make check")


0.5.7
-------------

Multiple regular expressions can now be supplied for --substitute.

For example:
  % cclive -S "s/old/new/i s/[/:-]/_/g" URL

Note the whitespace between the regular expressions.


0.5.6
-------------

Added --substitute which mimics Perl's s/old/new/(gi) substitution.
It can be used to replace substrings in output filenames.

Example:
  % cclive -S "s/old/new/i" URL
  % cclive -S "s/[/:-]/_/g" URL

Changed --regexp to accept Perl-like regular expressions, e.g.
  % cclive -r "/(\w+)/" URL
  % cclive -r "/(\w+)/g" URL
  % cclive -r "/([a-e])/gi" URL

Note that this breaks the backward compatibility.
  * --regexp now expects /pattern/(gi)
  * --find-all is no longer supported (use /g instead)

Added --background which is similar to what clive (2.1.x) once had.
The progress indication while in the background is very simplistic.
Note that --logfile and --logfile-interval options were also added
to support --background.


0.5.2
-------------

New youtube format: fmt34. This was previously referred to as youtube
default format which no longer appears to be the case. Note that the
fmt34 video quality and resolution may vary.

Fixes a few bugs.

Redtube support is broken.

0.5.0
-------------

The dependency of Perl and HTML::Tokenizer module have been replaced with
libiconv and PCRE for significantly lower system footprint. Perl was previously
used for parsing video titles and cleaning them up.

configure no longer supports --enable-sigwinch. The support is now compiled
into the program automatically if signal.h is found and defines SIGWINCH.

tests/ have been rewritten in C++.

Other notable changes:

  Removed options:
  --title
    - obsoleted by --filename-format since 0.4.1 
  --cclass, --no-cclass
    - obsoleted by --regexp and --find-all (below)

  New options:
  -r, --regexp
    - Defines the regular expression that can be used to "filter"
      video titles before they are used for filenames

  -g, --find-all
    - Used together with the above to repeat the matching to find
      all occurences, similar to Perl's /g option

  Example:
    cclive -gr "(\w|\s)" URL
