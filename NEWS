News about cclive releases
--------------------------

Release 0.5.0
-------------

The dependency of Perl HTML::Tokenizer Perl module have been replaced with
iconv and pcrecpp (c++ bindings for pcre). Perl (or libperl) was a rather
steep requirement after all.

cclive previously only allowed the use of video titles in filenames if it
was built with Perl support. It now uses video title for filenames by default.

cclive can now be built with the *optional* iconv (to convert character sets)
and pcrecpp (to custom filter video titles) support, but these are only
recommendations.

Due to these changes, the following options have been removed in this release:
--title (obsolete since 0.4.1 after adding --filename-format), --cclass and
--no-cclass (previously used with Perl, replaced with --regexp and --find-all).

  -r, --regexp [req. pcrecpp]
    - Defines the regular expression that can be used to "filter"
      video titles before they are used for filenames

  -g, --find-all [req. pcrecpp]
    - Used together with the above to repeat the matching to find
      all occurences, similar to Perl's /g option

  Example:
    cclive -gr "(\w|\s)" URL
