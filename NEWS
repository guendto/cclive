0.6.0
-------------

* Add dependency for libquvi (http://quvi.googlecode.com/).
Due to this change, cclive no longer contains host specific
code for parsing video pages. All of this is now done by
the libquvi.

* Due to libquvi design, cclive now retries from page fetch if
video link verification fails

* CCLIVE_CURLINIT return code is now obsolete and possibly
reused in the future -- libquvi takes care of initializing
libcurl

* libiconv is no longer used by cclive as libquvi takes
care of character set conversions from now on


0.5.2
-------------

New youtube format: fmt34. This was previously referred to as youtube
default format which no longer appears to be the case. Note that the
fmt34 video quality and resolution may vary.

Fixes a few bugs.

Redtube support is broken.

0.5.0
-------------

The dependency of Perl and HTML::Tokenizer module have been replaced with
libiconv and PCRE for significantly lower system footprint. Perl was previously
used for parsing video titles and cleaning them up.

configure no longer supports --enable-sigwinch. The support is now compiled
into the program automatically if signal.h is found and defines SIGWINCH.

tests/ have been rewritten in C++.

Other notable changes:

  Removed options:
  --title
    - obsoleted by --filename-format since 0.4.1 
  --cclass, --no-cclass
    - obsoleted by --regexp and --find-all (below)

  New options:
  -r, --regexp
    - Defines the regular expression that can be used to "filter"
      video titles before they are used for filenames

  -g, --find-all
    - Used together with the above to repeat the matching to find
      all occurences, similar to Perl's /g option

  Example:
    cclive -gr "(\w|\s)" URL
