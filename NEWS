News about cclive releases
--------------------------

Release 0.5.0
-------------

The dependency of Perl HTML::Tokenizer Perl module have been replaced with
libiconv and PCRE for significantly lower system footprint. Perl was used to
parse and cleanup the video titles before using them for filenames.

Additionally, cclive now parses the video pages with PCRE.

  Removed options:
  --title
    - obsolete since 0.4.1 by --filename-format
  --cclass, --no-cclass
    - obsoleted by --regexp and --find-all (below)

  New options:
  -r, --regexp [req. pcrecpp]
    - Defines the regular expression that can be used to "filter"
      video titles before they are used for filenames

  -g, --find-all [req. pcrecpp]
    - Used together with the above to repeat the matching to find
      all occurences, similar to Perl's /g option

  Example:
    cclive -gr "(\w|\s)" URL

  SIZE = total size of the process (text, data, and stack)
  RES  = current amount of resident memory

  Note  : Amounts are approximates. cclive was built with "-O2 -march=pentium4"
  Tested: FreeBSD 7.2, readings collected from top(1)

configure no longer supports --enable-sigwinch. The support is now compiled
into the program if signal.h is found and it defines SIGWINCH.
