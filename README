About cclive
------------

cclive is a lightweight command line video extraction tool for Youtube and
other similar video websites. It is a rewrite of the clive software in C++
with lower system footprint and fewer dependencies.

cclive is primarily a "video download tool" but it can also be used for
emitting parsed video links for other software to use.

cclive integrates with media player software, such as C<mplayer>, allowing it
to be used instead of the Adobe flash plugin which is required by the websites
to view the streamed videos.
