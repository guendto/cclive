cclive is command line video extraction utility similar to clive but with
lower requirements. Its features are few and essential. 

If you are interested in contributing, or you have test feedback,
please see the TODO file.


                What's not in cclive?

In comparison to clive(1), cclive does not have the following features:

 * No clipboard support ("xclip -o | cclive" works OK)
 * No output filename formatting features
 * No --emit-xml
 * No cache

There are other minor differences but these are the most notable ones.
A significant difference are the prerequisites and runtime requirements.

cclive can be used together with clive-utils (excl. clivepass):
