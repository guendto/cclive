cclive is a command line video extraction utility similar to clive but
focusing on low requirements. Its features are few and essential. 

If you are interested in contributing, please see the TODO file.


                cclive != clive

While cclive shares many of the same features with clive, some features were
left out in order to keep the prerequisites low.

 * No clipboard support (use "xclip -o | cclive")
 * No cache (+bdb prereq., probably not missed by many)
 * No <title> parsing (+htmlparser prereq., +proper utf8 support, overkill)
 * Limited --emit features (CSV only)
 * No fancy filename formatters (std. "$host_$id.$suffix, +--output-video)

Apart from clivepass, cclive can be used together with the clive utilities
(clive-utils).
