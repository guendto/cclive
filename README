About cclive
------------

cclive is a lightweight command line video extraction tool for Youtube and
other similar video websites. It is a rewrite of the clive software in C++
with lower system footprint and fewer dependencies.

cclive is intended to be used as a workaround tool for websites that require
the Adobe flash player plugin and no other means to view the video content
in an external player software.

cclive is primarily a "video download tool" but it can also be used along side
with video player software, like "mplayer", for viewing streamed videos instead
of the Adobe flash player.
