About cclive
------------

cclive is a lightweight commandline video extraction tool for Youtube
and similar video Websites. It is a rewrite of the clive software in
C++ with a smaller system footprint and fewer dependencies. It is
primarily a "video download tool", but can be used with video player
software like "mplayer" for viewing streamed videos in place of the
Adobe flash player. 

cclive is designed to be used as a workaround tool for websites that
require the Adobe flash player plugin for viewing the video content.
