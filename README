cclive is command line video extraction utility similar to clive but with
lower requirements. Its features are few and essential. 

If you are interested in contributing, or you have test feedback,

                What's not in cclive?

Compared to clive(1), some of the most notable differences between clive(1)
and cclive(1) are:

 * No clipboard support ("xclip -o | cclive" works OK)
 * No output filename formatting features
 * No --emit-xml
 * No cache
 * No --background


                Notes
