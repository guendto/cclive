Installation
============

Notes
-----

* This document does not cover how to use GNU Autotools for building
  and installing software, instead, refer to the GNU Autotools
  documentation, the INSTALL file and the "configure --help" output for
  more information.

* If you're not familiar with GNU Autotools and/or installing software
  from the source code, you may prefer to install cclive using a binary
  package, instead. You can find cclive packaged for many distros
  already.

* If you have previously installed cclive from the source code to your
  system, the recommended practice is to uninstall the previous
  installation first, before you continue with the new one. You would,
  typically, run "make uninstall" (as root if necessary) from the same
  directory you ran "make install" from.

* If you are building cclive from the git repository code, run the
  `bootstrap.sh' first. This generates the configuration files. See also
  the -h output for any additional info.


Simple install procedure
------------------------

  % ./configure && make

  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install

The configure script supports also the following options which are
relevant to the installation:

  --with(out)-manual
    Install the manual page for cclive

  --(enable|disable)-ccl (default:yes)
    Make a symbolic link from 'cclive' (executable) to 'ccl'.
