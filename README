------------

cclive is command line video extraction utility similar to clive
but with lower requirements.

Mini-FAQ
--------

Q: Can I contribute to the project?
-----------------------------------

Absolutely, please see the HACKING file to get started.

Q: How is cclive different from clive?
--------------------------------------

Apart from being written in C++, some of the less used features
are not implemented in cclive. Please see the next question for
more on this.

clive requires that Perl is installed along with a number of modules
that clive depends on. cclive on the other hand is designed to
build (by default) with only a C++ compiler and libcurl. This means
also that the runtime dependencies are fewer and the system footprint
is much less for cclive than it is for clive.

Although Perl is very portable, cclive appears to have gained many
ports to different platforms in a fairly short period of time. Some
examples are the BSD, various Linux distros, Solaris, OS/2 and Mac.
In theory at least, cclive should build and run on MSWindows with
the help of the mingw or the cygwin projects, although we have not
received any confirmation on this.

Both projects benefit from the existence of one another. clive,
has attracted developers familiar with the Perl programming
language to contribute to the project, whereas those more familiar
with C++ have contributed to the cclive project. This has then
often lead to porting the changes from one project to another.

Q: What are the missing features?
---------------------------------

clive currently supports a slightly wider array of video hosts,
although cclive has been catching up with it. clive also supports
the use of a video page cache which is not available in cclive.

Q: Can I use clive-utils with cclive?
-------------------------------------

Yes, excluding clivepass.
