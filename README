cclive is command line video extraction utility similar to clive but with
lower requirements. Its features are few and essential. 

If you are interested in contributing, or you have test feedback,
please see the TODO file.


                cclive != clive

cclive and clive share much of the same features. Some have been excluded
from cclive to keep the prerequisites low. Others may have been implemented
differently or are unique to cclive. Notable differences:

 * No clipboard support
   - You can use "xclip -o | cclive" instead

 * No cache
   - Additional prerequisite (e.g. bdb)

 * No <title> parsing
   - Additional prerequisites
     - HTML parser/tokenizer +proper utf8 support
     - overkill (we would only want the <title>...)

 * Limited --emit features
   - CSV only

 * Simple video file naming
   - $host_$id.$suffix
   - option --output-video=FILE

cclive can be used together with clive-utils:

With the exception of clivepass.
