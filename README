cclive is a tool for downloading media from YouTube and similar
websites. It has a low memory footprint compared to other existing
tools.

Home  : http://cclive.sourceforge.net/
gitweb: http://repo.or.cz/w/cclive.git


Prerequisites
-------------

* libquvi       (0.4.0+)
* libboost      (1.42.0+)
* libpcre(cpp)  (8.02+)
* libcurl       (7.20.0+)

Note that cclive may or may not compile with earlier versions.
The above versions are the ones that I've tested.


Installation from source
------------------------

"./configure && make install", typically. See also "./configure --help".
If you are compiling cclive from the development code from the git
repository, see "Installation from development code", instead.

  --with(out)-manual  (default:yes)

    Do not install manual page(s)

  --(enable|disable)-ccl (default:yes)

    Make a symbolic link from 'cclive' (executable) to 'ccl'.


Installation from development code
----------------------------------

If you are compiling cclive from the development code, run "bootstrap.sh",
first. This generates the configuration files that are not in the git
repository. You will need:

  * Perl (with pod2man)
  * GNU autoconf
  * GNU automake
  * asciidoc (a2x) for producing the manual pages

Once the files have been generated, follow the instructions in "Installation
from source" above.
