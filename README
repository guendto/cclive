About cclive
------------

cclive is a lightweight command line video extraction tool for Youtube and
other similar video websites. It is a rewrite of the clive software in C++
with lower system footprint and fewer dependencies.

cclive is primarily a "video download tool" but it can be used for emitting
parsed video links for other software to use. It can also integrate with video
player software, such as "mplayer", making it possible to work around the Adobe
flash player requirement for streamed video.
