Q: How is cclive different from clive?

Apart from being written in C++, some of the less used features are
not implemented in cclive. clive currently supports a slightly wider
array of video hosts, although cclive has been catching up with it.
clive also supports the use of a video page cache which is not
available in cclive.

clive requires that Perl is installed along with a number of modules
that clive depends on. cclive on the other hand is designed to build
(by default) with only a C++ compiler and libcurl. This means cclive
has fewer runtime dependencies and a much lower system footprint.
