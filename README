cclive is command line video extraction utility similar to clive but with
lower requirements. Its features are few and essential. 

If you are interested in contributing, or you have test feedback,
please see the TODO file.


                cclive != clive

 * No clipboard support
   - You can use "xclip -o | cclive" instead

 * No cache
   - Additional prerequisite (e.g. bdb)

 * No <title> parsing
   - Additional prerequisites
     - HTML parser/tokenizer +proper utf8 support
     - overkill (we would only want the <title>...)

 * Limited --emit features
   - CSV only

 * Simple video file naming
   - $host_$id.$suffix
   - option --output-video=FILE

cclive can be used together with clive-utils:

With the exception of clivepass.
