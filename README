but with lower requirements.

Mini-FAQ
--------

Q: Can I contribute to the project?
-----------------------------------

Absolutely, please see the HACKING file.

Q: How is cclive different from clive?
--------------------------------------

Apart from being written in C++, some of the less used features
are not implemented in cclive.

clive also requires that Perl is installed along with a number of
modules that clive depends on, whereas cclive is designed to build
(by default) with only a C++ compiler and libcurl.

Runtime dependencies are usually even fewer and the system footprint
is typically much less than it is for running clive.

Q: What are the missing features?
---------------------------------

* --paste (you can use "xclip -o | cclive" instead for example)
* --filename-format
* --background
* --emit-xml
* --progress=type
* Cache 

Q: Can I use clive-utils with cclive?
-------------------------------------

Yes, excluding clivepass.
