About cclive
------------

cclive is a command line tool for downloading videos for Youtube
and similar websites. It is a rewrite of the clive software in
C++ with a smaller system footprint and fewer dependencies.

cclive was written to be used as a workaround tool for websites
that require the Adobe flash plugin to view the videos.
