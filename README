    In brief

cclive is a command line tool for downloading videos from Youtube and
similar websites that require flash for viewing. It is a rewrite of the
clive software in C++ with a smaller system footprint. It is not, nor
intended to become, an universal flash video download tool.

    Submitting patches

If you are using git:
  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" and fix them
  * Use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch

If you are working with diff, then at very least, use "diff -u" when you
generate the patch.

  * Preferred way to submit your patch is to use the patch tracker at:
    <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=354617&atid=1481233>

  * Or directly to the author <legatvs at sign gmail com>
