Prerequisites
-------------

* libquvi       (0.2.17+)
* libboost      (1.42.0+)
* libpcre(cpp)  (8.02+)
* libcurl       (7.20.0+)

Note that cclive may or may not compile with earlier versions.
The above versions are the ones that I've tested.


Installation from (release) source tarball
------------------------------------------

"./configure && make install", typically. See also "./configure --help".
See also "Installation from development code" further below.

    --without-man           Do not install manual page(s)


Installation from development code
----------------------------------

If you are compiling cclive from the development code, run "autogen.sh".
This generates the configuration files that are not in the git repository.
You will need:

  * Perl (with pod2man)
  * GNU autoconf
  * GNU automake

Once the files have been generated, you can follow the instructions in
"Installation from source tarball" above.
