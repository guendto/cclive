            Installation

 Typically "./configure && make install".


            Prerequisites

 * libcurl  (7.18.0+)  <http://curl.haxx.se/>

 * libpcre  (7.8+)     <http://pcre.org/>

 * libiconv (1.12.0+)  <http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>

   Some operating systems have iconv in the C library, for example glibc.
   Some have it in a separate library libiconv, for example OSF/1 or FreeBSD.
   Regardless of the operating system, GNU libiconv might have been installed.
   In that case, it should be used instead of the operating system's native
   iconv. 


            Notable ./configure options

 --enable-sigwinch
    If enabled, cclive will handle the SIGWINCH to resize the
    "progressbar" to match the terminal width. This is known
    to work on at least BSD and Linux systems.

 --enable-tests
    Enable tests that can be run by typing "make check". Note that
    cclive will use any settings defined in ~/.cclive while running
    the tests. To skip the internet based tests, define NO_INTERNET
    environment variable before "make check".

 --without-man
    Do not install cclive.1 manual page.


            Example

 # ./configure --enable-sigwinch
 # make install
