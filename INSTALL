            cclive installation

Normally you can just do "make" followed by "make install", that will install
the cclive program in your own ~/bin/ directory. If you want to do a global
install, you can do (as root):

 # make prefix=/usr install

The manual page is installed by default, if you do not need it:

 # make WITH_MAN=no install

When you uninstall, be sure to use the same prefix. For example:

 # make prefix=/usr uninstall

You can clean the source directory with "make clean". Developers may also
find the following make targets useful:

 cmdline # generate cmdline.h and cmdline.c from cmdline.ggo (req. gengetopt)
 man     # generate cclive.1 from cclive.pod (req. pod2man)


            Build-time options

 - WITH_MAN=(yes|no)        [default:yes]
    Whether the cclive.1 manual page should be installed

 - WITH_SIGWINCH=(yes|no)   [default:yes]
    Whether cclive should handle the SIGWINCH. cclive uses
    this signal to resize the progressbar as the terminal
    width changes. Should work on *BSD/Linux systems,
    possibly others, too.

 - WITH_PERL=(yes|no)       [default:no]
    Whether cclive should be build with embedded Perl interpreter.
    If "yes"
      * HTML::TokeParser Perl module becomes a new prerequisite
      * --title and --title-cclass options can be used
    If "no"
      * --title and --title-cclass options are disabled


            cclive prerequisites

 - libcurl (7.18.0+)

 - Perl 5.8+ with HTML::TokeParser module. This is optional,
 see WITH_PERL above.



            Examples

 BSD    : gmake prefix=/usr/local mandir=/usr/local/man install
    Recommended: cd /usr/ports/multimedia/cclive; make install clean

 Linux  : make prefix=/usr install


            Notes

 Debian 5.0+ packages (WITH_PERL=yes):
    apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libperl-dev liburi-perl \
        libhtml-tokeparser-simple-perl gcc make
