            cclive installation

Normally you can just do "make" followed by "make install", that will install
the cclive program in your own ~/bin/ directory. If you want to do a global
install, you can do (as root):

 # make prefix=/usr install

The manual page is installed by default, if you do not need it:

 # make WITH_MAN=no install

When you uninstall, be sure to use the same prefix. For example:

 # make prefix=/usr uninstall

You can clean the source directory with "make clean". Developers may also
find the following make targets useful:

 cmdline # generate cmdline.h and cmdline.c from cmdline.ggo (req. gengetopt)
 man     # generate cclive.1 from cclive.pod (req. pod2man)


            Build-time options

 - WITH_MAN=(yes|no)        [default:yes]
    Whether the cclive.1 manual page should be installed

 - WITH_SIGWINCH=(yes|no)   [default:yes]
    Whether cclive should handle the SIGWINCH. Should work
    on *BSD and Linux systems at least.
    If "yes"
      * progressbar resizes along with the terminal
    If "no"
      * progressbar remains at default size even if terminal width changes

 - WITH_PERL=(yes|no)       [default:no]
    Whether cclive should be build with embedded Perl interpreter.
    If "yes"
      * HTML::TokeParser Perl module becomes a new prerequisite
      * --title and --title-cclass options can be used
    If "no"
      * --title and --title-cclass options are disabled


            cclive prerequisites

 - libcurl (7.18.0+)

Optional:
 - Perl 5.8+ with HTML::TokeParser module. Currently needed for using --title.
 See also WITH_PERL above.


            Examples

 BSD    : gmake prefix=/usr/local mandir=/usr/local/man install

 Linux  : make prefix=/usr install
