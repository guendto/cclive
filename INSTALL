            Prerequisites

* libquvi    (0.2.0+)
* libboost   (1.43.0+)
* libpcrecpp (8.10+)
* libcurl    (7.20.0+)

-- Additionally for building

* gcc/++ (4.5.0+, 4.2 should be OK)
* cmake  (2.8.2+, looks for 2.8, see top-level CMakeLists.txt)

Note that cclive may or may not compile with earlier versions.
The above versions are the ones that I've tested.


    Installation

% mkdir  tmp; cd tmp
% cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
% make install
...
% make uninstall


    Installation: Variables

These are some of the frequently used ones.

    * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=(...PATH...)
        Install destination for cclive, default may vary.

    * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=(none|debug|release|relwithdebinfo|minsizerel)
        Type of build, default is debug.

    * CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=(true,false)
        Build with verbose makefiles, default is false.

    * WITHOUT_DOC=(true|false)
        Install without documentation (e.g. man/cclive.1), default is false.

Example:
    % mkdir tmp; cd tmp
    % cmake -DWITHOUT_DOC=true -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
    % make install

Take a look at the CMakeLists.txt files found in the source tree,
if you need to dig deeper. The cmake (2.8) documentation can be
found at:
    <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html>

Note that you could also run cmake with -i (wizard mode).


    Notes for porters and packagers

Please ask the platform specific questions from those familiar with your
platform. I develop cclive on Linux for Linux, and test it occasionally on
FreeBSD.

If you need an additional check for, e.g. a symbol or a function, see
the top-level CMakeLists.txt and config.h.in files. We can add those
at the upstream if that makes the porting easier.
