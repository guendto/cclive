            Installation

 Typically "./configure && make install".


            Known platforms and ports
 
 See:
   http://code.google.com/p/cclive/wiki/HowtoInstall


            Optional Packages

 --with-iconv[=PREFIX]  (recommended)
    Causes cclive to use libiconv for character set conversions.

 --with-pcrecpp[=PREFIX] (recommended)
    Allows use of --regexp and --find-all for cleaning up video titles
    before they are used for output filenames.

 --enable-sigwinch
    If enabled, cclive will handle the SIGWINCH to resize the
    "progressbar" to match the terminal width. This is known
    to work on at least BSD and Linux systems.

 --enable-tests
    Enable tests that can be run by typing "make check". Note that
    cclive will use any settings defined in ~/.cclive while running
    the tests. To skip the internet based tests, define NO_INTERNET
    environment variable before "make check".

 --without-man
    Do not install cclive.1 manual page.
