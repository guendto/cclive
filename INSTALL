            cclive installation

Normally "./configure" followed by "make install". This will make a global
installation. See "./configure --help" for more.


            Optional packages

--with-man
    If enabled (default), the manual page is installed with the program.
    Use --without-man to disable this.

--with-sigwinch
    If enabled (default), cclive supports SIGWINCH handling which is used
    to resize the progressbar to match the terminal width. This may not
    work on some platforms. Use --without-sigwinch to disable this.

--with-perl
    If enabled, Perl interpreter is embedded which allows cclive to parse
    video page titles which are then filtered and used to name the output
    files. The Perl library and HTML::Tokenizer module must be installed
    to the system before this. This feature is *disabled* by default.
    When enabled, the --title and --title-cclass options may be used.

Developers may also want to use the makefile targets "cmdline" and "man".

 cmdline
    regenerates cmdline.h and cmdline.c from cmdline.ggo. Note that this
    requires "gengetopt".

 man
    regenerates cclive.1 from cclive.pod. Note that this requires "pod2man".


            Prerequisites

 - libcurl (7.18.0+)

Optional:
 - Perl 5.8+ with HTML::TokeParser module. Currently needed for using --title.
 See --with-perl above.
