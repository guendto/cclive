Normally you can just do "make" followed by "make install", that will install
the cclive program in your own ~/bin/ directory. If you want to do a global
install, you can do (as root):

 # make prefix=/usr install

The manual page is installed by default, if you do not need it:

 # make WITH_MAN=no install

When you uninstall, be sure to use the same prefix. For example:

 # make prefix=/usr uninstall

You can clean the source directory with "make clean". Developers may also
find the following make targets useful:

 cmdline # generate cmdline.h and cmdline.c from cmdline.ggo (req. gengetopt)
 man     # generate cclive.1 from cclive.pod (req. pod2man)


            cclive prerequisites

            Examples

 BSD    : gmake prefix=/usr/local mandir=/usr/local/man install
 Linux  : make prefix=/usr install
