            cclive installation

Normally you can just do "make" followed by "make install", that will install
the cclive program in your own ~/bin/ directory. If you want to do a global
install, you can do (as root):

 # make prefix=/usr install

The manual page is installed by default, if you do not need it:

 # make WITH_MAN=no install

When you uninstall, be sure to use the same prefix. For example:

 # make prefix=/usr uninstall

You can clean the source directory with "make clean". Developers may also
find the following make targets useful:

 cmdline # generate cmdline.h and cmdline.c from cmdline.ggo (req. gengetopt)
 man     # generate cclive.1 from cclive.pod (req. pod2man)


            Build-time options

 - WITH_MAN=(yes|no)        [default:yes]
    Whether the cclive.1 manual page should be installed

 - WITH_SIGWINCH=(yes|no)   [default:yes]
    Whether cclive should handle the SIGWINCH. cclive uses
    this signal to resize the progressbar as the terminal
    width changes. Should work on *BSD/Linux systems,
    possibly others, too.

 - WITH_PERL=(yes|no)       [default:no]
    Whether build cclive with embedded Perl interpreter.
    This is currently used only to parse video page titles,
    see also the --title option in the manual page. Note
    that if this is enabled, make sure the following
    Perl modules have also been installed:
        * HTML::TokeParser
        * URI::Escape


            cclive prerequisites

 - libcurl library (7.18.0+)


            Examples

 BSD    : gmake prefix=/usr/local mandir=/usr/local/man install
 Linux  : make prefix=/usr install
