            Installation

 Typically "./configure && make install". See also "./configure --help".

 --enable-tests
    Enable tests that can be run by typing "make check". Note that
    cclive will use any settings defined in ~/.cclive while running
    the tests. To skip the internet based tests, define NO_INTERNET
    environment variable before "make check".

 --without-man
    Do not install cclive.1 manual page.
