0.2.2

 User-visible changes:
  * Added --number-videos
  * Fixed HTTP proxy support (main.c, opts.c)
    - Fixed: --no-proxy was not doing what was expected if http_proxy was set
    - Fixed: http_proxy was misshandled causing cclive to crash at exit
      - cclive set cc.gi.proxy_given variable if http_proxy env. var. was set
      - This caused the gengetopt code attempt to free invalid pointer
    - Changed: libcurl is now responsible for using http_proxy if it is set
      - --proxy can still be used to override the http_proxy value
  * Implemented SIGWINCH signal handling
    - cclive now resizes progressbar based on terminal width (min. 80 chars)
  * Fixed: --limit-rate no longer limits following page transfers after file dl

 Developer-visible changes:
  * Replaced remaining (excl. gengetopt generated) strcat with safer strlcat
  * Merged opts.c into main.c
  * Rewrote cclive struct
    - config parser (pp) is now freed immediately after parsing, should save
      some mem (opts.c)
    - Removed http_proxy_env from the struct (opts.c)
    - exec_mode is now a local variable (main.c)
    - Cleaned up parse_opts function (opts.c)
  * Added WITH_SIGWINCH to Makefile, e.g. "make WITH_SIGWINCH=no"
    - Builds cclive without the progressbar resizing feature described above
