0.2.2

 User-visible changes:
  * Implemented SIGWINCH signal handling
    - cclive now resizes progressbar based on terminal width (min. 80 chars)
  * Fixed: --limit-rate no longer limits following page transfers after file dl

 Developer-visible changes:
  * Rewrote cclive struct
    - Instead of carrying config parser (pp) instance throughout the program's
      lifespan, it is now freed immediately after parsing, should save some
      memory (opts.c)
    - Removed http_proxy_env from the struct, made it a local pointer (opts.c)
    - Similarly exec_mode is now a local variable
    - Cleaned up parse_opts function (opts.c)
  * Added WITH_SIGWINCH to Makefile, e.g. "make WITH_SIGWINCH=no"
    - Builds cclive without the progressbar resizing feature described above
