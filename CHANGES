    - persistant HTTP/404 (not found) error
  * Added --print-fname
  * Fixed file naming when output file exists already
    Symptoms: output file is called ".1" or ".2" etc.


0.2.2
(February 15, 2009)

 User-visible changes:
  * Added --number-videos
  * Fixed HTTP proxy support (main.c, opts.c)
    - Fixed: --no-proxy was ignored if http_proxy env. variable was set
    - Fixed: http_proxy env.v. was misshandled causing cclive to crash at exit
      - missused cc.gi.proxy_given by setting it to 1 when http_proxy was set,
        causing gengetopt generated code to try to free an invalid pointer
    - Changed: libcurl is now responsible for using http_proxy
      - option --proxy=address still overrides http_proxy definition
  * Implemented SIGWINCH signal handling
    - progressbar now resizes along with terminal width but not below 80 chars
  * Fixed: --limit-rate no longer limits following page transfers after file dl

 Developer-visible changes:
  * Replaced remaining (excl. gengetopt generated) strcat with safer strlcat
  * Merged opts.c into main.c
  * Rewrote cclive struct
    - config parser (pp) is now freed immediately after parsing
    - Removed http_proxy_env from the struct
    - exec_mode is now a local variable
  * Rewrote up parse_opts function
  * Added WITH_SIGWINCH to Makefile, e.g. "make WITH_SIGWINCH=no"
    - if != "yes" cclive is built without the resizing feature described above
      which depends on SIGWINCH and ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ)

 User-visible changes:
  * Tweaked progressbar to fit better
